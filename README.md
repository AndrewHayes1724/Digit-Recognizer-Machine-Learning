# Overview



This project is a cool Machine learning program that I have been trying to do for a while now. It still isn't perfect, but I think it is pretty cool. Essentially it takes a drawing input of a digit, and the program tells you what digit it is based on your drawing, as well as a percent accuracy. 

My purpose for creating this software was really to take a model and train the program to learn how to figure out what a user inputs. This is used in a lot of scenarios on the internet and I wanted to see if I could create a program to replicate the AI that does this.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode to develop the python only, but I actually just used the command prompt to download all the libraries and such (using pip), as well as to run/test the program.

I used Python 3
* Keras
* numpy 
* Tkinter (comes in standard Python Library but I should mention it)

# Useful Websites

* [W3 Schools ML Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_getting_started.asp)
* [Keras.io](https://keras.io/)

# Future Work

* The program doesn't recognize everything accurately. So some further training needs to occur / optimization
* I would like to eventually create some sort of word prediction AI so not just recognizing the letter but entire words even before they are fully written. 
* Create this as an Android App would be cool.
